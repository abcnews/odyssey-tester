                <p>Are we human because of unique traits and attributes not shared with either animal or machine? The definition

                    animal and machine). It is a definition by negation: that which separates us from animal and machine
                    is our "human-ness".</p>

                <p>We are human because we are not animal, nor machine. But such thinking has been rendered progressively less
                    tenable by the advent of evolutionary and neo-evolutionary theories which postulate a continuum in nature
                    between animals and Man.</p>
                <p>Our uniqueness is partly quantitative and partly qualitative. Many animals are capable of cognitively manipulating
                    symbols and using tools. Few are as adept at it as we are. These are easily quantifiable differences
                    – two of many.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>Qualitative differences are a lot more difficult to substantiate. In the absence of privileged access to
                    the animal mind, we cannot and don't know if animals feel guilt, for instance. Do animals love? Do they
                    have a concept of sin? What about object permanence, meaning, reasoning, self-awareness, critical thinking?
                    Individuality? Emotions? Empathy? Is artificial intelligence (AI) an oxymoron? A machine that passes
                    the Turing Test may well be described as "human". But is it really? And if it is not – why isn't it?</p>
                <p>Literature is full of stories of monsters – Frankenstein, the Golem – and androids or the humans around them.
                    This, perhaps, is what really sets humans apart: their behavioural unpredictability. It is yielded by
                    the interaction between Mankind's underlying immutable genetically-determined nature – and Man's kaleidoscopically
                    changing environments.</p>

                    hand, are determinists. They believe that human nature – being the inevitable and inexorable outcome
                    of our bestial ancestry – cannot be the subject of moral judgment.</p>

                <p>An improved Turing Test would look for baffling and erratic patterns of misbehaviour to identify humans.
                    Pico della Mirandola wrote in "Oration on the Dignity of Man" that Man was born without a form and can
                    mould and transform – actually, create – himself at will. Existence precedes essence, said the Existentialists
                    centuries later.</p>
                <p>The one defining human characteristic may be our awareness of our mortality. The automatically triggered,
                    "fight or flight", battle for survival is common to all living things (and to appropriately programmed
                    machines). Not so the catalytic effects of imminent death. These are uniquely human. The appreciation
                    of the fleeting translates into aesthetics, the uniqueness of our ephemeral life breeds morality, and
                    the scarcity of time gives rise to ambition and creativity.</p>
                <p>In an infinite life, everything materializes at one time or another, so the concept of choice is spurious.
                    The realization of our finiteness forces us to choose among alternatives. This act of selection is predicated
                    upon the existence of "free will". Animals and machines are thought to be devoid of choice, slaves to
                    their genetic or human programming.</p>

                <p>Yet, all these answers to the question: "What does it mean to be human" – are lacking.</p>
                <p>The set of attributes we designate as human is subject to profound alteration. Drugs, neuroscience, introspection,
                    and experience all cause irreversible changes in these traits and characteristics. The accumulation of
                    these changes can lead, in principle, to the emergence of new properties, or to the abolition of old
                    ones.</p>

                <p>Animals and machines are not supposed to possess free will or exercise it. What, then, about fusions of machines
                    and humans (bionics)? At which point does a human turn into a machine? And why should we assume that
                    free will ceases to exist at that – rather arbitrary – point?</p>
                <p>Introspection – the ability to construct self-referential and recursive models of the world – is supposed
                    to be a uniquely human quality. What about introspective machines? Surely, say the critics, such machines
                    are PROGRAMMED to introspect, as opposed to humans. To qualify as introspection, it must be WILLED, they
                    continue. Yet, if introspection is willed – WHO wills it?</p>
                <p>Self-willed introspection leads to infinite regression and formal logical paradoxes. Moreover, the notion
                    – if not the logical paradoxes.mal concept – of "human" rests on many hidden assumptions and conventions.</p>

                    <p>The Emerald Buddha is a figurine of a sitting Budha, that is the is the palladium of the Kingdom of Thailand.
                        The Buddha is made of green jade, suprisingly not of emerald, clothed in gold is approximately 45
                        cm tall. The Buddha is kept in the Chapel of the Emerald Buddha, which is located on the grounds
                        of the Grand Palace in Bangkok.</p>
                    <p>Legend tells that the Emerald Buddha was created in Pataliputra, India, which is now the city of Patna
                        in 43 BCE by Nagasena. Other great historians beleive that it belongs to the Chiang Saen Style of
                        the 15th century. The legend says that, it remained in Pataliputra for 300 hundred years, until it
                        was taken to Sri Lanka to save it from a civil war. It was then in 457, that King Anuruth of Burma
                        sent out orders to Ceylon to ask for the Emerald Budha and Buddhist scriptures. These actions took
                        place by the king, to try and support Buddhism in his country. This request was granted, however
                        the ship that was brining the Buddha to Burma, became lost in a storm and ended up in Cambodia. The
                        Buddha made its way through several hands after that: Ayutthaya, Kamphaeng Phet, Lao and finally
                        Chiang Rai. It was finally in Chiang Rai that the ruler of the city hid it.</p>

                        there is no need for any external reward before it is performed. Examples are love of the task, self-satisfaction,
                        sense of achievement, relaxation purpose, etc.</p>
                    <p>External motivation in performing a task occurs when the task is performed because of an external reward.
                        Examples are praise, recognition, money, stickers, grades, material rewards, etc.</p>

                    <p>Motivation can be seen as a continuum from being externally driven to becoming more internally driven.
                        All of us start off in life being externally driven. Remember how many children are bribed with sweets
                        or stickers, and do things to get praise from adults. But as we mature and our material needs become
                        more satisfied, we become more internally driven. Though intrinsic motivation is generally accepted
                        as being better as it is within the internal control of the person, external motivation is useful
                        in helping a person initially to get on a task when he does not feel intrinsically motivated to do
                        so.</p>
                    <p>LASIK is a surgical procedure that is capable of correcting a wide range of nearsightedness (myopia),
                        farsightedness (hyperopia) and astigmatism. More than 1 million patients undergo the LASIK procedure
                        in the United States each year.</p>
                    <a name="share"> </a>
                    <p>Most patients notice an improvement in their vision immediately upon completion of their surgery. By
                        the next day, vision is often dramatically improved. However, patients should understand that while
                        fast visual recovery characterizes the operation, it can take several months before some patients
                        achieve their final vision after LASIK. Several studies demonstrate that the vision of a number of
                        patients continued to improve up to six months post-operatively. During that time, patients may experience
                        slight fluctuations in vision throughout the day. These symptoms generally diminish with time.</p>
                    <p>For some patients, vision after LASIK matches the sharpness of vision they had with glasses or contact
                        lenses before the procedure. However, an estimated 1.5 million LASIK patients still face a return
                        to glasses as their near vision begins to diminish with age. Fortunately, there's another procedure-recently
                        approved by the FDA-to help treat presbyopia, the common condition known as "aging eyes."</p>

                    <p>Using laser treatment to quit smoking is considered to be one of the most effective smoking cessation
                        methods. This method was introduced to the public only in the recent years and is considered to be
                        a rather modern and even innovation method.</p>
                    <p>The laser quit smoking system is based upon a simple and very old principle. It is a well known fact
                        that certain point in human body are nerve centers and they can encourage changes in the body. This
                        principle is used in many disciplines such as acupuncture, reflexology, shiatsu and more. The point
                        is, if you apply pressure to certain points in human body, you can get certain predictable effects.</p>
                    <p>This principle is used in stop smoking laser treatment. Low intensity laser beam is applied to those
                        specific point in your body. The result is an almost immediate reduction of the cravings that accompany
                        the smoking cessation.</p>
                    <p>This way you can go through the first stages of quitting smoking without the cravings associated with
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Naturally, reducing the cravings is not always enough, as there are more aspects to quitting smoking.
                        Therefore, the laser treatment goes very well along with behavioral therapy that will eliminate the
                        psychological aspects of addiction. The laser simply deals with the physical Nicotine addiction.</p>

                        <p>The treatment is very "clean" and has no side effects, like some of the medications people take to
                            quit smoking.</p>
                        <p>So, is Laser treatment to quit smoking a good idea for you?</p>
                        <p>Well, you must consider the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It could be quit expensive. Prices very, and you should compare a few clinics before choosing.
                                Some health insurances cover the cost of this treatment, so check it with your health insurance.</li>
                            <li>You should plan to combine the laser treatment with behavioral therapy. Undergoing a laser treatment
                                only will not give you good results in many cases.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Besides from that, laser treatment to quit smoking is a good choice to make as a quit smoking aid.
                            Just remember that you really have to want to quit in order to make it. Laser treatment will
                            help, but it's you that actually quits smoking.</p>

                        <p>It wasn't until 1434 that sources indicate the resurfacing of the statue in Northern Thailand. There
                            is one story about the discovery: "lightning struck a pagoda in a temple in Chiang Rai, after
                            which something became visible under the stucco. The Emerald Buddha was dug out and the people
                            thought the figurine was made from emerald, hence its current name."</p>
                        <p>Motivation can be simply defined as the things that induce us to take certain actions or behave in
                            a certain way. It is the why or the reason that drives a person towards a desired goal.</p>
                        <p>The reasons can be categorized into something that is within us i.e. intrinsic / internal motivation,
                            or something that is external to us i.e. extrinsic / external motivation.</p>

                        <p>While it was just a TV show, that little speech at the beginning of the original Star Trek show really
                            did do a good job of capturing our feelings about space. It is those feelings that drive our
                            love of astronomy and our desire to learn more and more about it.</p>
                        <p>The thing that is most exciting about studying the universe is also the most frustrating and that
                            is that no matter how expert we get, we are always just getting started. But if it's any consolation,
                            some of the most advanced minds in science and from history always felt that way about space.
                            Even the greats such as Copernicus and Einstein looked up into space and felt like they were
                            just a spec in the presence of such infinity.</p>

                        <p>The Emerald Buddha is a figurine of a sitting Budha, that is the is the palladium of the Kingdom
                            of Thailand. The Buddha is made of green jade, suprisingly not of emerald, clothed in gold is
                            approximately 45 cm tall. The Buddha is kept in the Chapel of the Emerald Buddha, which is located
                            on the grounds of the Grand Palace in Bangkok.</p>
                        <p>Legend tells that the Emerald Buddha was created in Pataliputra, India, which is now the city of
                            Patna in 43 BCE by Nagasena. Other great historians beleive that it belongs to the Chiang Saen
                            Style of the 15th century. The legend says that, it remained in Pataliputra for 300 hundred years,
                            until it was taken to Sri Lanka to save it from a civil war. It was then in 457, that King Anuruth
                            of Burma sent out orders to Ceylon to ask for the Emerald Budha and Buddhist scriptures. These
                            actions took place by the king, to try and support Buddhism in his country. This request was
                            granted, however the ship that was brining the Buddha to Burma, became lost in a storm and ended
                            up in Cambodia. The Buddha made it's way through several hands after that: Ayutthaya, Kamphaeng
                            Phet, Lao and finally Chiang Rai. It was finally in Chiang Rai that the ruler of the city hid
                            it.</p>
